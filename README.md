## Idea

Project based on the 'birthday reminder' by John Smilga via freeCodeCamp.org -- which in turn was based on uidesigndaily.com's 'birthday list card'. The CSS was straight-up stolen and modified slightly. 

It's all a big borrowing chain, isn't it?

## Future Directions
If I were to spend anymore time on this app:
